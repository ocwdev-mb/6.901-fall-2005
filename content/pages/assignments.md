Problem Set 3

*   Read the following documents for discussion at our next class and to give you ideas for final projects:
    *   Shulman, Seth. "When Patenting Works." _The Technology Review_ (July/August 2002).
    *   [Global School District Patent](http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=2&u=/netahtml/search-bool.html&r=57&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=ptxt&s1=5,974,446&OS=5,974,446&RS=5,974,446)

*   This week's discussion relates to patenting emerging areas of science. Discuss the following topics:

    *   Should the U.S. Supreme Court rethink its "anything under the sun" policy regarding patentability?
    *   Why? Is it to promote innovation? Or will people still take the risk to develop these new technologies even without the protections afforded by the patent system.
